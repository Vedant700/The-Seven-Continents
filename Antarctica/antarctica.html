            Geography
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">Antarctica is Earth's southernmost
            continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern
            Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At
            14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly
            twice
            the size of Australia. It is by far the least populated continent, with around 5,000 people in the
            summer
            and around 1,000 in the winter. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi;
            6,200 ft) in thickness.
            <br>
            <br>
            Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average
            elevation of all the continents. Most of Antarctica is a polar desert, with annual precipitation of 200
            mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland; yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored
            there,
            enough to raise global sea levels by about 60 metres (200 ft) if all of it were to melt. The
            temperature in Antarctica has dropped to −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) (or even −94.7 °C or −138.5 °F, as
            measured
            from space), though the average for the third quarter (the coldest part of the year) is −63 °C (−81 °F).
            Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and
            certain
            animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is
            tundra.
            <br>
            <br>
            Antarctica was the last region on Earth to be discovered, likely unseen until 1820 when the Russian
            expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the
            Fimbul
            ice shelf. The continent remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its
            harsh
            environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In January 1840, land at Antarctica was
            discovered for the first time, almost simultaneously, by the United States Exploring Expedition, under
            Lieutenant Charles Wilkes; and a separate French expedition under Jules Dumont d'Urville. The latter
            made a
            temporary landing. The Wilkes expedition—though it did not make a landing—remained long enough in the
            region
            to survey and map some 1,300 kilometres (800 mi) of the continent. The first confirmed landing was by a
            team
            of Norwegians in 1895.

            Antarctica is governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic
            Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities,
            mineral mining, nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal. It supports scientific research and
            protects
            the continent's ecology. Between 1,000 and 5,000 people from many countries reside at research stations
            scattered across the continent.

            history
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            Antarctica has no indigenous population.

            Belief in the existence of a Terra Australis—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance"
            the
            northern lands of Europe, Asia and North Africa—had prevailed since the times of Ptolemy in the 1st
            century
            CE. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not
            part
            of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual
            size.
            Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named Terra Australis—this
            name
            was given to Australia instead, because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist
            further south. Explorer Matthew Flinders, in particular, has been credited with popularising the
            transfer of
            the name Terra Australis to Australia. He justified the titling of his book A Voyage to Terra Australis
            (1814) by writing in the introduction:
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be
            found in
            a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the
            geographical
            importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and,
            having
            no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other
            which
            could have been selected.
            <br>
            <br>
            European maps continued to show this hypothetical land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS Resolution
            and
            Adventure, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.
            Cook came within about 120 km (75 mi) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice
            in
            January 1773. In 1775, Cook called the existence of a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of
            his journal he wrote: "firmly believe it and it's more than probable that we have seen a part of
            it".
            <br>
            <br>
            According to various organisations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of
            California, San Diego, the Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, among others),
            ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: Fabian Gottlieb von
            Bellingshausen, a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy, Edward Bransfield, a captain in the Royal Navy,
            and
            Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer.
            <br>
            <br>
            The First Russian Antarctic Expedition led by Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on the 985-ton
            sloop-of-war
            Vostok ("East") and the 530-ton support vessel Mirny ("Peaceful") reached a point within 32 km (20 mi)
            of
            Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W, on 27 January
            1820, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted the
            land of the Trinity Peninsula of Antarctica, as opposed to the ice of an ice shelf, and ten months
            before
            Palmer did so in November 1820. The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer
            John
            Davis, apparently at Hughes Bay, near Cape Charles, in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some
            historians dispute this claim. The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adare in 1895
            (by the Norwegian-Swedish whaling ship Antarctic).
            <br>
            <br>
            The oldest known human remains in Antarctica was a skull that belonged to a young woman on Yamana Beach
            at
            the South Shetland Islands, which dates back to 1819 to 1825, who was likely part of a sealing
            expedition.
            She was found in 1985.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 22 January 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the Balleny Islands, some members
            of
            the crew of the 1837–40 expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville disembarked on the highest islet of a group
            of coastal rocky islands about 4 km from Cape Géodésie on the coast of Adélie Land where they took some
            mineral, algae, and animal samples, erected the French flag and claimed French sovereignty over the
            territory.
            <br>
            <br>
            Explorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island
            (both
            of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross
            Ice
            Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS Erebus and
            Terror. Mercator Cooper landed in East Antarctica on 26 January 1853.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David became the
            first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the
            leadership
            of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring
            in
            1931. In addition, Shackleton and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December
            1908 – February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse
            the
            Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar
            Plateau.
            An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram became the first to
            reach
            the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel
            Heiberg
            Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.
            <br>
            <br>
            Richard E. Byrd led several voyages to the Antarctic by plane in the 1930s and 1940s. He is credited
            with
            implementing mechanised land transport on the continent and conducting extensive geological and
            biological
            research. In 1937, Ingrid Christensen became the first woman to step onto the Antartic
            mainland. Caroline Mikkelsen had landed on an island of Antarctica, earlier in 1935.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was not until 31 October 1956, that anyone set foot on the South Pole again; on that day a U.S. Navy
            group led by Rear Admiral George J. Dufek successfully landed an aircraft there. The next women to step
            onto the South Pole were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, Lois Jones, Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry
            Tickhill in 1969.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the southern hemisphere summer of 1996–97 the Norwegian explorer Børge Ousland became the first
            person to
            cross Antarctica alone from coast to coast. Ousland got aid from a kite on parts of the distance. All
            attempted crossings, with no kites or resupplies, that have tried to go from the true continental edges,
            where the ice meets the sea, have failed due to the great distance that needs to be covered.For this
            crossing, Ousland also holds the record for the fastest unsupported journey to the South Pole, taking
            just
            34 days.

            Climate
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">Antarctica is the coldest of Earth's continents. It was ice-free until about 34
            million years ago, when
            it
            became covered with ice. The lowest natural air temperature ever recorded on Earth was −89.2 °C (−128.6
            °F) at the Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983. A lower air temperature of −94.7 °C
            (−138.5 °F) was recorded in 2010 by satellite—however, it may have been influenced by ground
            temperatures
            and was not recorded at a height of 2 metres (7 ft) above the surface as required for official air
            temperature records. Temperatures reach a minimum of between −80 °C (−112 °F) and −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F)
            in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5 °C (41 °F) and 15 °C (59 °F) near the coast
            in
            summer.Signy Island recorded a temperature of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in January 1982, the
            highest temperature ever recorded in the Antarctic region (including non-continental islands).

            Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation; the South Pole receives less than 10 mm (0.4
            in)
            per year, on average. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the
            ultraviolet light falling on it. Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant
            sunlight
            create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.

            The aurora australis, commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near
            the
            South Pole created by the plasma-full solar winds that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is
            diamond dust, a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise
            clear
            or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A sun dog, a
            frequent atmospheric optical phenomenon, is a bright "spot" beside the true sun.

            Facts

        <div class="box">
            Antarctica is home to several volcanoes <br> and two of them are active. Mount <br> Erebus, the
            second-highest
            volcano in
            <br> Antarctica is the southernmost active <br> volcano on Earth.

        <div class="box1">
            Although there are low levels of precipitation <br> in Antarctica, meteorological wonders <br> abound and
            diamond dust is
            one <br> of them!
            Diamond dust is made <br> of tiny ice crystals that precipitate <br> out of humid air near the Earth’s <br>
            surface. It’s a
            little like <br> an icy fog. As ice crystals hang suspended <br> in the air, sunlight causes them to <br>
            sparkle, creating a
            glittering effect <br> that looks like a million tiny floating <br> diamonds. Diamond dust is also
            responsible
            <br> for
            beautiful optical phenomena <br> like sun dogs, halos and light pillars.
