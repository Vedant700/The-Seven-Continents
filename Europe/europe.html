            Geography
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">Europe is a continent which is also recognised as part of Eurasia, located entirely
            in the Northern
            Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the
            continental
            landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa, and
            is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to
            the
            south and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of
            the
            Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways
            of
            the Turkish Straits. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is mostly regarded as its own
            continent because of its great physical size, the weight of its history and cultures, and its great
            influence on world history.
            <br>
            <br>
            Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land
            area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is
            divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning
            39% of
            the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 746 million
            (about 10% of the world population) in 2018. The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic
            currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the
            climate
            in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than
            close to the coast.
            <br>
            <br>
            European culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece
            and
            ancient Rome. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and the subsequent Migration Period
            marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism,
            exploration, art and science led to the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, started by Portugal and
            Spain, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European
            powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of
            Asia.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Age of Enlightenment, the subsequent French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent
            culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the
            19th
            century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave
            rise
            to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both
            world
            wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in
            world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence. During
            the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in
            the
            East, until the revolutions of 1989, fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1949, the Council of Europe was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals and
            prevent future wars. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European
            Union
            (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation. The EU originated
            in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The
            currency
            of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the
            EU's
            Schengen Area abolishes border, and immigration controls between most of its member states and some
            non-member states. There exists a political movement favouring the evolution of the European Union into
            a
            single federation encompassing much of the continent.

            history
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            The first recorded usage of Eurṓpē as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in
            reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first
            used
            in the 6th century BCE by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and
            Europe
            along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River on the territory of Georgia) in the Caucasus, a
            convention
            still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE. Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided
            by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis
            forming
            their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as
            the
            boundary between Europe and Asia. Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer
            Strabo at the River Don. The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his
            three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar,
            separating it from Northwest Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.
            <br>
            <br>
            The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used
            by
            Roman-era authors such as Posidonius, Straboand Ptolemy, who took the Tanais (the modern Don
            River) as the boundary.
            <br>
            <br>
            The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century.
            From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both
            the
            Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.
            <br>
            <br>
            A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century,
            signifying
            the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin
            culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the
            British
            Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy. The
            concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: Europa often
            figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.

            Climate
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">Europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones, being subjected to prevailing
            westerlies. The climate
            is
            milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the
            Gulf
            Stream. The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate
            warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's
            coast
            but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Aveiro is 16 °C (61 °F), while it is only 13
            °C
            (55 °F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude, bordering the same ocean. Berlin,
            Germany;
            Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in far south-eastern Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January
            temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (14 °F) higher than those in Calgary and they are almost 22
            °C
            (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.
            <br>
            <br>
            The large water masses of the Mediterranean Sea, which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily
            average, are also of particular importance. The water of the Mediterranean extends from the Sahara
            desert to
            the Alpine arc in its northernmost part of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste.
            <br>
            <br>
            In general, Europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south, but it also gets colder
            from
            the west towards the east. The climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east. This can be
            illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the 64th,
            60th,
            55th, 50th, 45th and 40th latitudes. None of them is located at high altitude; most of them are close to
            the
            sea. (location, approximate latitude and longitude, coldest month average, hottest month average and
            annual
            average temperatures in degrees C)

            Languages
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">Europe has about 225 indigenous languages, mostly falling within three Indo-European
            language groups:
            the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose
            ancestor
            language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages. Slavic languages are mostly spoken
            in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in Western and Southern
            Europe, as well as in Switzerland in Central Europe and Romania and Moldova in Eastern Europe. Germanic
            languages are spoken in Western, Northern and Central Europe as well as in Gibraltar and Malta in
            Southern
            Europe. Languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps (such as in English, for example). Other
            Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the Baltic group (Latvian and Lithuanian),
            the
            Celtic group (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton), Greek, Armenian and Albanian.
            <br>
            <br>
            A distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Erzya, Komi,
            Mari,
            Moksha and Udmurt) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, Hungary and parts of Russia. Turkic languages
            include Azerbaijani, Kazakh and Turkish, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast
            Europe
            (Balkan Gagauz Turkish, Bashkir, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai and Tatar).
            Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian and Svan) are spoken primarily in Georgia. Two other language
            families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar
            and
            Lezgin; and Northwest Caucasian, most notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language
            that
            is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in
            Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and
            the
            Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for
            language rights in Europe.
