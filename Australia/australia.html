            Geography
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of
            the
            Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. With an area of 7,617,930
            square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi), Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's
            sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent,
            with the least fertile soils. It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of
            landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and
            mountain
            ranges in the south-east.
            <br>
            <br>
            Indigenous Australians have inhabited the continent for approximately 65,000 years. The European
            maritime exploration of Australia commenced in the early 17th century with the arrival of Dutch
            explorers.
            In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal
            transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's
            national day. The European population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s
            gold
            rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing
            crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of
            Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and wealthy
            market
            economy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Politically, Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten
            territories. Australia's population of nearly 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on
            the eastern seaboard. Canberra is the nation's capital, while the largest cities are Sydney, Melbourne,
            Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Australia's demography has been shaped by centuries of immigration, with
            immigrants accounting for 30% of the country's population, the highest proportion among major Western
            nations. Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are
            crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services,
            mining
            exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education.
            <br>
            <br>
            Australia is a highly developed country with a high-income economy; it has the world's twelfth-largest
            economy, tenth-highest per capita income and eighth-highest Human Development Index. Australia is a
            regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure. Australia ranks highly in
            quality of life, democracy, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties, safety, and political
            rights, with all its major cities faring exceptionally in global comparative livability surveys. It
            is a member of international groupings including the United Nations, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, ANZUS,
            AUKUS, Five Eyes, the Quad, APEC, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community and the Commonwealth
            of
            Nations.

            Climate
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including
            the Indian Ocean
            Dipole
            and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal
            tropical
            low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia. These factors cause rainfall to
            vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly
            summer-rainfall (monsoon). The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate. The
            south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New
            South
            Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to
            semi-arid.
            <br>
            <br>
            Driven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than 1°C since 1960. Associated changes
            in
            rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires. 2019
            was
            Australia's warmest recorded year,and the 2019–2020 bushfire season was the country's worst on
            record. Australia's greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to
            chronic
            shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought. Throughout much of the
            continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river
            systems,
            overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in
            the
            early 2010s after the 2000s Australian drought

            Languages
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            Although Australia has no official language, English is the de facto national language. Australian
            English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon, and differs slightly
            from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling. General Australian serves as the standard
            dialect.
            <br>
            <br>
            According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for 72.7% of the
            population.
            The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (2.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.2%),
            Vietnamese (1.2%) and Italian (1.2%). Over 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have
            existed at the time of first European contact, of which fewer than twenty are still in daily use by all
            age groups. About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people. At the time of the 2006
            census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they
            spoke an Indigenous language at home. Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main
            language of about 10,112 deaf people who reported that they use Auslan language at home in the 2016
            census.
