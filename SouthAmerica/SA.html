                Geography
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere and mostly in
                the
                Southern
                Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the
                southern subregion of a single continent called America (see the United Nations geoscheme for the
                Americas).
                The reference to South America instead of other cultural or geographical regions (such as Latin America
                or
                the Southern Cone) has increased in recent decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular,
                the
                rise of Brazil).
                <br>
                <br>
                South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic
                Ocean;
                North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve
                sovereign
                states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay,
                and
                Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich
                Islands; and one internal territory: French Guiana.] In addition, the ABC islands of the
                Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da
                Cunha, a
                British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago may
                also
                be considered parts of South America.
                <br>
                <br>
                South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2018
                has
                been estimated at more than 423 million. South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and
                North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far
                the
                most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's population, followed by
                Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the
                continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the
                far
                south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes
                mountains; in
                contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the
                Amazon,
                Orinoco and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the
                Southern
                Cone located in the middle latitudes.
                <br>
                <br>
                The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples
                with
                European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of
                colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and
                states reflect Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, 20th-century South America has
                been
                a peaceful continent with few wars.

                history
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">South America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late
                Paleozoic
                Era to the early
                Mesozoic
                Era, until the supercontinent Pangaea began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago.
                Therefore,
                South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.
                <br>
                <br>
                South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering
                Land
                Bridge (now the Bering Strait) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia.
                They
                migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of
                Panama.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC,
                when
                squashes, chili peppers and beans began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the Amazon Basin.
                Pottery evidence further suggests that manioc, which remains a staple food today, was being cultivated
                as
                early as 2000 BC.
                <br>
                <br>
                By 2000 BC, many agrarian communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions.
                Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of
                food.
                Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.
                <br>
                <br>
                South American cultures began domesticating llamas, vicuñas, guanacos, and alpacas in the highlands of
                the
                Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for
                transportation of goods.

                Climate
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">The distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant
                regularity from the 30°
                of
                latitude south, when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.
                <br>
                <br>
                In temperate latitudes, winters and summers are milder than in North America. This is because the most
                extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone (the region has more areas of equatorial
                plains
                than any other region.), therefore giving the Southern Cone more oceanic influence, which moderates year
                round temperatures.
                <br>
                <br>
                The average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27 °C (81 °F), with low thermal
                amplitudes and high rainfall indices. Between the Maracaibo Lake and the mouth of the Orinoco,
                predominates
                an equatorial climate of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.
                <br>
                <br>
                The east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts
                of
                the Argentine pampas have a humid subtropical climate with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese
                type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the
                highest
                points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the
                Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the
                altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this
                point
                until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, Mediterranean oceanic climate, temperate of
                the
                Breton type and, already in Tierra del Fuego, cold climate of the Siberian type.
                <br>
                <br>
                The distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the tropical
                region east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the
                Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak
                Intertropical Convergence Zone, South Atlantic tropical cyclones are rare. In the Orinoco Llanos and in
                the Guianas Plateau, the precipitation levels go from moderate to high. The Pacific coast of Colombia
                and
                northern Ecuador are rainy regions, with Chocó in Colombia being the rainiest place in the world along
                with
                the northern slopes of Indian Himalayas.The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the
                driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to extratropical
                cyclones,
                and most of the Argentine Patagonia is desert. In the Pampas of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil
                the
                rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the
                Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the semiarid coast of the
                Brazilian
                Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.
                <br>
                <br>
                Important factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and
                Falklands. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is
                divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards
                the
                Antilles, where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean
                current in the world, the Gulf Stream.

            <div class="text-container">Spanish and Portuguese are the most spoken languages in South America, with
                approximately 200 million
                speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in
                some
                countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. Dutch is the official language of Suriname;
                English is the official language of Guyana, although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in
                the
                country, including Portuguese, Chinese, Hindustani and several native languages. English is also spoken
                in the Falkland Islands. French is the official language of French Guiana and the second language in
                Amapá,
                Brazil.
                <br>

                Indigenous languages of South America include Quechua in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia;
                Wayuunaiki in northern Colombia (La Guajira) and northwestern Venezuela (Zulia); Guaraní in Paraguay
                and, to
                a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; Aymara in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and Mapudungun is
                spoken
                in certain pockets of southern Chile. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua,
                Aymara,
                and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other languages found in South America include Hindustani and Javanese in Suriname; Italian in
                Argentina,
                Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and German in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil. German is also
                spoken
                in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, Riograndenser Hunsrückisch being the most widely
                spoken
                German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of East Pomeranian is
